Topic: autumn
Golden leaves descend,
Nature's tapestry unfolds,
Whispers in the wind.

Crisp leaves twirl and fall
Harvest moon winks in the sky
Nature's warm embrace

Leaves dance in the wind,
Colors blend in harmony,
Season's canvas sways.



Topic: summer
Golden rays of sun
Whisper secrets to the breeze
Summer dreams take flight

Golden sunsets fade
Crickets hum in twilight's song
Heat lingers no more

Golden sunsets fade,  
Cicadas hum their sweet song,  
Awakening dreams.
